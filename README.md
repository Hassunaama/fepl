A programming language for creating Minecraft Servers. An easy way to create servers using code.

FEPL is a programming language that generates Minecraft Servers. What that means is that you can now not only use compicated java things and plugin configs but code your minecraft server easilly instead, using a "verbal" and abstracted representation as well. This is especially useful for using GD triggers, which (if you want to make complicated stuff) are not really suited for the graphical workflow of the in-game editor.
